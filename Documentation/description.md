# PROJECT DESCRIPTION 


## Project Title: Book Master

## Book Master - Bookstore Management System

## Project description 

Book Master is a web-based application that is supposed to assist with inventory and sales management of a book store. A Bookstore owner will be able to handle client accounts, make transactions, and keep track of their inventory all in one location using this system. The customers also have access to it as they can see their history all process transactions themselves too. The program will connect to a database to store data and use Java with object-oriented programming techniques. The main goal of this project is to create a practical solution for bookstore management while demonstrating understanding of key OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, implementation of different classes and overall demonstrate how each of them interconnect to deliver a working computing environment. 


## Key Features

## 	 Book Management

•	Add new books to the inventory
•	Update book information (title, author, price, etc.)
•	Remove books when they're sold out or discontinued
•	Search for books by title, author, or genre


## 	User System

-	Customer registration and login
-	Admin accounts for store management


## 	Shopping Features

-	Shopping cart functionality
-	Checkout process
-	Order confirmation




## 	Categories and Organization

-	Organize books by genre
-	Create featured book collections
-	Bestseller tracking


## 	Database Integration

	Store book information
	Save user accounts
	Keep track of sales records


## All these features will be sub-divided the following system Architectures:

## 1. UI Interface
The web-based user interface will include:

•	Admin Dashboard 

-	Book management panel
-	User management section
-	Inventory status overview + reports and analytics

•	Customer Interface 

-	Book browsing and search functionality (work with the database to retrieve what books are available)
-	Shopping cart and checkout process
-	User account management(such as editing profile)
-	Order history view

•	Other UI Features 

-	Forms, validations of forms with their corresponding error messages
-	Tables for output layouts

## 2. Backend Code
The Java backend will implement:
-	Class Hierarchy (consisting all classes as shown in the class diagram)
-	Interfaces 
-	OOP Concepts Implementation

o	Inheritance: Through the class hierarchies
o	Polymorphism: Methods like behaving differently based on book type
o	Encapsulation: Private fields with getter/setter methods
o	Exception handling: Custom exceptions for various error scenarios

## 3. Database
The database will contain:
For reference, the database schema gives a visual representation of how we want it to look like
-	Tables 
-	Database Functions 
-	Data Relationships
